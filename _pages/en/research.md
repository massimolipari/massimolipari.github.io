Below are brief summaries of some of the various projects I'm currently working on.

#### Cross-linguistic and inter-speaker variation in sibilant acoustics

I'm working on developing a new speech database for comparing patterns of cross-linguistic and inter-speaker variation. I'm adapting a number of large read speech corpora originally created for automatic speech recognition technology development, taken from a variety of sources, for phonetic research. To date, data for 32 languages and more than 4,600 speakers have been collected. I use this database in a submitted paper examining the spectral dynamics of /s/ [(preprint here)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/m4ksy_v1), and in ongoing work investigating how much of apparent gender differences in sibilant acoustics is physiologically-grounded (due to variation in vocal tract length) versus performed across languages.

#### Variation and change in Quebec French

I maintain the *ParlBleu* corpus of spoken Quebec French, a corpus of parliamentary speech created from proceedings of the National Assembly of Quebec, which can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/35fk8/). This is an expanded version of Peter Milne's *AssNat* corpus [(described in his thesis)](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/items/b76e477e-316b-4ee3-b7fd-49463f807248). I've lead work (with help from [Laurie Dumont](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurie-dumont-9690262bb/)) to bring the corpus up to a total size of more than 31 hours of data across 156 speakers and to collect as much speaker metadata as possible to allow for sociolinguistic analyses. In [a 2025 paper in *Laboratory Phonology*](https://doi.org/10.16995/labphon.11678), I use the corpus to investigate the development of a rhotic quality in the vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/, examining change in F3 trajectory shape in apparent time and describing the social and regional patterning of rhoticity in Quebec French.

#### Articulation and acoustics in English rhotics

I'm also collaborating with [Eleanor Lawson](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/lawsoneleanordr/) (University of Strathclyde) and [Jane Stuart-Smith](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/janestuart-smith/) (University of Glasgow) on the relationship between tongue shape (bunched versus retroflex articulation) and formant (F1--F4) trajectories in rhotic sounds across varieties of English (Scottish, Irish, and North American). We're investigating the extent to which formant patterns systematically relate to tongue shape, a point on which evidence from previous work is mixed.
