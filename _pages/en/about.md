I'm a fourth-year PhD student in phonetics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, affiliated with the [Montréal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/) and the [Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music (CRBLM)](https://crblm.ca/). My supervisors are Profs. [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/).

Most of my work falls under the label of corpus phonetics, but touches on a broad set of topics. These include the dynamics of speech, language variation and change, the mapping between articulation and acoustics, and the phonetic/phonology interface. Here are my main ongoing projects:

1. I maintain a corpus of Quebec French speech data, the *AssNat* parliamentary corpus originally developed by Peter Milne [(described in his thesis)](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/items/b76e477e-316b-4ee3-b7fd-49463f807248). I've led work that has tripled the size of the corpus, and have collected speaker metadata to allow for sociolingusitic analyses. The corpus is planned to be made public soon, but for the time being you can request access [here](https://github.com/massimolipari/corpus_assnat).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/multi-language-al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
