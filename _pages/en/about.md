I'm a doctoral candidate in phonetics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, affiliated with the [Montréal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/) and the [Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music (CRBLM)](https://crblm.ca/). My supervisors are Profs. [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/).

Most of my work falls under the label of corpus phonetics, but touches on a broad set of topics. These include the dynamics of speech, language variation and change, the mapping between articulation and acoustics, and the phonetic/phonology interface. 

In a previous life, I studied a bit of semantics, philosophy of language, and logic, and I have some experience teaching these topics as well.

In English, I pronounce my name [ˈma.sɪ.moʊ lɪˈpa.ɹi], but I'm not very picky (especially about the quality of the low vowels).
