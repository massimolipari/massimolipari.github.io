I'm a fourth-year PhD student in phonetics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, affiliated with the [Montréal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/) and the [Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music (CRBLM)](https://crblm.ca/). My supervisors are Profs. [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/).

Most of my work falls under the label of corpus phonetics, but touches on a broad set of topics. These include the dynamics of speech, language variation and change, the mapping between articulation and acoustics, and the phonetic/phonology interface. Here are my main ongoing projects:

1. I maintain a corpus of Quebec French speech data, the *AssNat* parliamentary corpus originally developed by Peter Milne [(described in his thesis)](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/items/b76e477e-316b-4ee3-b7fd-49463f807248). I've led work that has tripled the amount of audio data and collected speaker metadata to allow for sociolingusitic analyses. The corpus is planned to be made public soon, but for the time being you can request access [here](https://github.com/massimolipari/corpus_assnat).

2. I study sound change in Quebec French (using the aformentioned corpus). I'm especially interested in a typologically rare sound change, namely the development of rhoticity in the vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. Using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), I examine the change in formant trajectory shape in apparent time and describe the social and regional patterning of rhoticity. Ultimately, this project aims to address questions relating to the actuation and spread of sound change.

3. I also work on the acoustic dynamics of sibilants. Recent work (not yet published) explores variability in acoustic dynamics of /s/ both within and across languages in the large-scale [GlobalPhone](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6639248?casa_token=zfOt03SbtdgAAAAA:NKnjKjoAUaAlqlOWqCuaRwPZX_EKSsXD9Y4A_uZsHvj7tc3r5qy0u85wQukp6yThW10Up0k) read speech corpus, using functional principal components analysis (fPCA) to determine the primary dimensions of interest.

4. I am at the early stages of a collaboration with [Prof. Jane Stuart-Smith](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/janestuart-smith/) (University of Glasgow), where we will be investing the articulatory and acoustic dynamics of rhotic consonants in Scottish English and other Englishes.

In a previous life, I studied a bit of semantics, philosophy of language, and logic, and I have some experience teaching these topics as well.

In English, I pronounce my name [ˈma.sɪ.moʊ lɪˈpa.ɹi], but I'm not very picky (especially about the quality of the low vowels).
