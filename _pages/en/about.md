I'm a phonetician and doctoral candidate in linguistics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, where I'm supervised by [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/). I'm affiliated with the [Montréal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/), the [Speech Learning Lab](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/), and the [Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music (CRBLM)](https://crblm.ca/).

My research examines language variation and change, phonetic typology, and sociophonetics, primarily using large-scale speech corpora I have collected or adapted for phonetic analysis. I work on a broad range of empirical phenomena, including fine phonetic detail in vowels, sibilants, and rhotic sounds. I'm also interested in the phonetics-phonology interface, the mapping between articulation and acoustics, and the dynamics of speech.

In English, I pronounce my name [ˈma.sɪ.moʊ lɪˈpa.ɹi], but anything close is fine!
